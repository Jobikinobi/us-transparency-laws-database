## Vector Search Applications

This dataset is optimized for:

1. **Jurisdiction Lookup**: "What are the FOIA requirements for [state]?"
2. **Comparative Analysis**: "Which states have the fastest response times?"
3. **Process Guidance**: "How do I appeal a denial in [state]?"
4. **Fee Research**: "What are the typical costs for FOIA requests?"
5. **Exemption Analysis**: "What types of records are typically exempt?"
6. **Strategic Planning**: "What obstacles should I expect in [state]?"

## Future FOIA Generator Integration

This knowledge base provides:
- **Jurisdiction-specific templates**: Tailored request language
- **Procedural automation**: Automated follow-up and appeal processes  
- **Cost estimation**: Budget planning for multi-state campaigns
- **Success optimization**: Evidence-based strategy recommendations
- **Compliance verification**: Ensuring requests meet all requirements

## Technical Notes
