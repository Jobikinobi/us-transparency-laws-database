# Statutory Validation Branch - State Transparency Laws

## Project Overview

This branch contains systematically validated statutory data for transparency laws (FOIA/public records acts) across all US jurisdictions. Each entry represents **verified ground truth** extracted directly from official government sources and cross-referenced with recent legislative updates.

## Critical Accuracy Standards

- **100% Accuracy Required**: This database serves as ground truth for AI training
- **Official Sources Only**: All data verified against official government websites
- **Recent Legislative Updates**: Cross-referenced with 2023-2025 legislative activity
- **Complete Documentation**: Full validation trail for every entry
