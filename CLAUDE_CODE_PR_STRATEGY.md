# Claude Code PR Review Strategy

## 🤖 Leveraging Claude Code GitHub App for Branch Consolidation

With the Claude Code GitHub app now configured on your repository, we have a powerful new approach for consolidating the parallel database branches.

## 📋 Enhanced Workflow

### Step 1: Create Pull Requests
Since both branches are already on GitHub, create PRs directly via the GitHub web interface:

1. **PR #1: Validated Dataset Branch**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Jobikinobi/us-transparency-laws-database/pull/new/source-validated-dataset-20240926
   - Title: "📊 Consolidate: Complete Validated Dataset (51 Jurisdictions)"
   - Description: Include what's in this branch (120 files, individual state folders)
   - Label: `data-consolidation`

2. **PR #2: Statute Project Branch**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Jobikinobi/us-transparency-laws-database/pull/new/source-statute-project-20240926
   - Title: "🚀 Consolidate: Supabase Integration & Architecture"
   - Description: Include Supabase features and organization structure
   - Label: `architecture`

### Step 2: Claude Code Automated Review
Once PRs are created, Claude Code will:
- 🔍 **Analyze code changes** for quality and consistency
- 📊 **Check data integrity** across all 51 jurisdictions
- 🔒 **Review security** of Supabase integration
- 📚 **Validate documentation** completeness
- ⚠️ **Identify conflicts** between the branches

### Step 3: AI-Assisted Merge Strategy

#### Priority Order:
1. **First merge**: `source-validated-dataset-20240926`
   - Contains complete verified data
   - Individual state process maps
   - Base data layer

2. **Then merge**: `source-statute-project-20240926`
   - Adds Supabase integration
   - Organization architecture
   - Platform specifications

#### Conflict Resolution Rules:
```yaml
When conflicts occur:
  data_conflicts:
    - Prefer verified_date: newer
    - Prefer validation_status: "verified" over "unverified"
    - Prefer completeness: more_fields over fewer_fields

  structure_conflicts:
    - Keep: Supabase integration files
    - Keep: Organization templates
    - Merge: Documentation files

  file_organization:
    - Consolidate: Duplicate files with same data
    - Preserve: Unique files from both branches
    - Archive: Outdated versions in /archive
```
