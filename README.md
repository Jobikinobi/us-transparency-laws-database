# State and Federal Transparency Law Statute Project

## Project Objective
Create a comprehensive, verified database of current transparency laws (FOIA/public records acts) for all 50 states, DC, and federal jurisdictions. This database will serve as ground truth for AI model training and power the transparency database/map via Supabase.

## Critical Requirements
- **100% Accuracy**: Every statute must be current, verified, and accurate
- **Complete Coverage**: All 51 jurisdictions (50 states + federal)
- **Standardized Format**: Consistent data structure across all entries
- **Source Verification**: All information must be traceable to official sources
- **Current Data**: Laws as of 2024/2025 with latest amendments

## Current Data Status
- **UNVERIFIED**: Existing files in `Unverified-50-State-Transparency-statutes/` contain potentially outdated or incorrect information
- **INCONSISTENT**: Data structure varies between files and jurisdictions
- **INCOMPLETE**: Missing jurisdictions and standardized fields

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Data Analysis & Structure Design
1. Analyze existing data for inconsistencies and gaps
2. Design standardized data structure
3. Identify verification sources for each jurisdiction

### Phase 2: Verification & Research
1. Verify federal FOIA statute (5 U.S.C. ยง 552)
2. Research and verify each state's transparency law
3. Ensure all information is from official government sources
4. Document source URLs and validation dates

### Phase 3: Data Generation
1. Create master comprehensive file
2. Generate individual jurisdiction files
3. Implement consistent naming and structure
4. Add validation metadata

### Expected Deliverables
- **Master File**: Single comprehensive JSON/CSV with all 51 jurisdictions
- **Individual Files**: One verified file per jurisdiction
- **Documentation**: Source verification and validation status
- **Quality Assurance**: 100% accuracy validation

## Data Structure (Proposed)
Each jurisdiction entry will include:
- Official statute name and citation
- Response timeframes
- Appeal processes
- Fee structures
- Exemptions
- Official portals/resources
- Validation metadata (date, sources, verification status)

## Timeline
Target completion: Current session for complete verified dataset
